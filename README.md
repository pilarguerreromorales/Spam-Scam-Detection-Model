## Overview
In this repository we have included all the process made to produce our Scam/Spam Detection Model in different folders and it


## Repository Structure
The following shocases the structure of the main folders in the repository. Additional README.md files have been included in some folders to facilitate usability and understanding.

project/
├── Application/         # The python code to run our prototype/demo
├── Notebooks/           # All notebooks used throughout the project, including trials and main
├── Outputs/             # The instructions to download the saved outputs by the team for easier/faster implementation
├── data/                # Original datasets and manual dataset download instructions, most data generated in the repository must be saved here
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies needed to run the repository properly
└── README.md

## Known Limitations
- Base or Original data used for the project is limited: has repetitive examples and strucutres that are easily learnt by models.
- Github's repository size: due to the limited space allowed in free accounts, notebook outputs had to be cleared and some files need to be manually downloaded and included in different folders in order to replicate this project. To counter this, some of the checkpoints used throughout the project are included in a shared Drive folder for manual download.
- **IMPORTANT**: some file paths throughout some notebooks **must be changed/adapted** to personal usage.
